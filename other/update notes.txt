FIXED/IMPROVED:

KNOWN BUGS:
-When HTE breaks down during run and files are generated from multiple runs, SeqLine in
XML file starts counting over again, throwing off my system
-Ligands 29, 53, 80, 81, and 84 can't translate (29, 80, 81, 84 have 1 unmatched ring 
bond, 53 has no smiles string)
-Need better splash and .ico and other thing

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
-Pie chart fill counterclockwise, so unaccounted must be given first
-For remote access, files must be stored to group drive

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
-bring back individual well view in separate app/tab

-need way to indicate both yield and ratio in the same graphic, thinking half of pie as 
yield and half as ratio

-methods for the entire process to be fully automated for repeat, RELIABLE experiments?

-repairfiles function for HTE breakdown (see: KNOWN BUGS)

-export images at full, presentation quality

-use some wells hand entered by user to test for 'confidence' in answer

-ability to filter final display and show most succesful and reaction conditions, etc.

-add variable filter function to present

-ability to gather data from multiple plates with or without different conditions

-could add back process now?

-need filters on pull

-need to add debugging options
